Pembroke Welsh Corgi

The Pembroke Welsh Corgi hails from Pembrokeshire, Wales. It's believed to have been in Wales for over 1,000 years. According to legend, the Corgi was a gift from woodland fairies, and the markings on their coats were left by fairy harnesses and saddles.

They are known for their short stature due to their short legs, and their long bodies. The breed has erect ears and a fox-like appearance. They have a double coat that can come in a variety of colors, including sable, fawn, red and stone. They may also have white markings.

Coat Colors

Adult Pembroke Welsh Corgis typically weigh between 24 to 30 pounds for males and 24 to 28 pounds for females. Their height at the shoulder usually ranges between 10 to 12 inches.

Pembroke Welsh Corgis are known for being affectionate, loyal, and good-natured. They are also alert and vigilant, making them excellent watchdogs. They are highly intelligent and quick learners, which makes them excel in obedience and herding events.

#### How to succeed

1. Use the background.svg file to create a tiled background on the body of the site, as shown on the mockup.
2. Create a navigation menu to match the mockups using the supplied SVGs.
3. When a user hovers over a nav menu item, use CSS to change the color of both the text AND the inline SVG.
4. Insert the `logo.svg` to match the mockup using the inline SVG method.
5. Use the corgi.svg to create a `<symbol>` element for corgis in the the index.html file.
6. Use the `<use>` element to recreate four copies of the corgi svg in the layout of index.html matching the mockup.
7. Use the ‘currentColor’ CSS value to make the body of each corgi unique, matching the mockup.
8. Add a CSS transition or animation effect to the logo hover state or page load.
9. Add a CSS transition or animation effect to the corgi hover state or page load.
10. Add a CSS transition or animation effect to the nav menu hover state or page load.
