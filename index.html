<h1>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h1>
    <p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi hails from Pembrokeshire, Wales.
        It's believed to have been in Wales for over 1,000 years.
        According to legend, the Corgi was a gift from woodland fairies, and the markings on their coats were left by
        fairy harnesses and saddles.
    </p>

        The breed has erect ears and a fox-like appearance.
        They have a double coat that can come in a variety of colors, including sable, fawn, red and stone.
